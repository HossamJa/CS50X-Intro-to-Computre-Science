# CS50x Problem Set 1: C – Week 1

**Completed 100%** – All challenges submitted (both easier and more comfortable versions)  
**Language:** C  
**Environment:** VS Code with gcc compiler

This folder contains my complete solutions for **Problem Set 1**, marking my official transition from Scratch to **C programming** — the foundation of systems-level development.

## Challenges Completed

| Problem             | Version Submitted         | Description |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Hello**           | `hello.c`                 | Classic "Hello, World" program – my first C code! |
| **Mario (Less)**    | `mario-less/`             | Prints a right-aligned pyramid of height 1–8 using `#` blocks |
| **Mario (More)**    | `mario-more/`             | Prints a **double-sided** Mario pyramid with a 2-space gap in the middle |
| **Cash**            | `cash/`                   | Greedy algorithm: calculates minimum coins needed for change |
| **Credit**          | `credit/`                 | Validates credit card numbers using **Luhn’s Algorithm** and identifies card type (AMEX, Mastercard, Visa) |

**I completed and submitted every version** — both "less comfortable" and "more comfortable" — to fully master the concepts and push my understanding of C.

## Key Skills Learned

- Compiling and running C programs with `make` and `./program`
- Using `printf`, `scanf`, and proper format specifiers
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Conditional statements and logical control flow
- String manipulation and character checking
- Implementing real-world algorithms:
  - **Greedy algorithms** (Cash)
  - **Checksum validation** (Luhn’s Algorithm in Credit)
- Input validation and error handling
- Code style and readability (following CS50 Style Guide)

## Favorite Challenge

**Credit** – Implementing **Luhn’s Algorithm** from scratch and correctly identifying card types based on number patterns was incredibly satisfying. It felt like writing real-world validation logic used by banks!

## Project Structure

```
1-C/
├── hello/          → hello.c
├── mario-less/     → mario.c (single pyramid)
├── mario-more/     → mario.c (double pyramid with gap)
├── cash/           → cash.c (greedy coin change)
└── credit/         → credit.c (Luhn + card detection)
```

All programs pass `check50` and `style50` with full credit.

## Final Thoughts

Going from visual blocks in Scratch to writing **real C code** that compiles and runs in the terminal was a massive milestone. This problem set taught me that programming isn’t just about syntax — it’s about **logic, precision, and problem-solving**.

**From `#include <stdio.h>` to Luhn’s Algorithm — I’m officially a C programmer.**

**Next stop: More C, strings, and memory management in Problem Set 2!**
